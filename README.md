# Diabetes-risk-analysis
# Comparative Analysis of Diabetes Risk Factors and Hospital Readmission Patterns

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares two main aspects of diabetes care using publicly available healthcare datasets:
1. Identify key clinical and demographic factors associated with diabetes diagnosis.
2. Understand hospital readmission patterns among diabetic patients within 30 days.

The purpose is to discover common risk factors influencing both diabetes diagnosis and hospital readmissions, which may indicate systemic challenges in diabetes management.

## Data Sources
1. **Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999–2008)**  
   Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
   Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes-130-us-hospitals-for-years-1999-2008  

2. **100,000 Diabetes Clinical Dataset**  
   Source: Kaggle  
   Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/100000-diabetes-clinical-dataset  

Both datasets contain sufficient information for demographic, clinical, and readmission-related analysis. Data preprocessing and cleaning will be required before performing analysis.

## Analytical Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summarize and visualize demographic and clinical distributions.  
   - Examine correlations between variables such as glucose, BMI, and age.  
   - Identify missing values and outliers.

2. **Statistical and Predictive Modeling**  
   - Conduct hypothesis testing to compare diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.  
   - Build predictive models to estimate readmission likelihood.  
   - Compare key features between datasets to identify shared predictors.
